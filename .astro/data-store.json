No matter how experienced you are, there's always something new to discover, a technique to master, or a perspective to explore.\n\n## The Digital Journey\n\nOver the past few months, I've been exploring different camera systems. I rented and reviewed both the [FujiFilm X-Pro2](/blog/fujifilm-x-pro2-review) and the [Sony A7r II](/blog/sony-a7r-ii-review), experiencing firsthand the incredible capabilities of modern digital cameras. These cameras offer:\n\n- Instant feedback\n- Unlimited shots\n- Advanced autofocus systems\n- High ISO performance\n- In-camera processing\n\nBut something was missing.\n\n## The Film Inspiration\n\nAfter reading several articles about film photography, particularly black and white film, I felt drawn to explore this \"outdated\" medium. There's something romantic about the process – the anticipation, the deliberation, the craft.\n\nI started my film journey by borrowing a Minolta SRT-201 from my father-in-law. But as often happens with photography gear, I quickly found myself wanting more. That's when I discovered the Leica M3.\n\n## The Leica M3: A Timeless Classic\n\n> \"The LEICA M3 is the best camera that LEICA has ever made, and by many accounts, the best camera of all time.\"\n\nThe Leica M3, introduced in 1954, represents the pinnacle of mechanical camera design. No autofocus, no light meter, no automatic modes – just you, the camera, and your understanding of light.\n\n## Why Film Makes You Better\n\nFilm photography forces you to slow down and be intentional in ways that digital doesn't:\n\n### 1. **Limited Shots**\nWith only 36 exposures per roll, every frame counts. You can't spray and pray – each shot requires thought and intention.\n\n### 2. **No Instant Feedback**\nYou can't chimp (constantly check the LCD). You have to trust your skills and understanding of exposure.\n\n### 3. **Manual Everything**\nFilm cameras, especially older ones, require you to understand the fundamentals:\n- The relationship between aperture, shutter speed, and ISO\n- How to read light without a meter\n- Zone focusing techniques\n- Composition without cropping\n\n### 4. **The Cost Factor**\nFilm and processing aren't free. This economic reality makes you more selective about when you press the shutter.\n\n## The Results\n\nWorking with film has transformed my approach to photography. Even when I pick up my digital camera, I find myself:\n\n- Taking fewer, more thoughtful shots\n- Paying more attention to composition in-camera\n- Better understanding light and exposure\n- Appreciating the moment rather than the screen\n\n## Not Abandoning Digital\n\nThis isn't about abandoning digital photography – each medium has its place. Digital excels for:\n- Professional work requiring immediate results\n- Situations where you need high ISO performance\n- When learning and experimentation are priorities\n\nBut film offers something different: a connection to the craft, a slower pace, and images with a distinctive character that's hard to replicate digitally.\n\n## Getting Started with Film\n\nIf you're interested in trying film photography:\n\n1. **Start Simple**: Borrow or buy an inexpensive film camera\n2. **Learn the Basics**: Understand manual exposure\n3. **Shoot Black and White**: It's forgiving and teaches you about light and shadow\n4. **Find a Good Lab**: Or learn to develop yourself\n5. **Be Patient**: Embrace the slower pace\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFilm photography isn't just about nostalgia or being contrarian. It's about understanding the fundamentals of photography in a way that makes you better, regardless of what camera you're holding. \n\nSometimes, less really can be more.","src/content/blog/less-can-be-more-film-photography.md","439d8cb51ae6d56e",{"html":28,"metadata":29},"\u003Ch1 id=\"less-can-be-more-my-leap-into-film-photography\">Less Can Be More: My Leap Into Film Photography\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Photography is a hobby that offers continuous learning opportunities.

But not just any photos – deliberate, thoughtful practice is what separates snapshots from art.\n\n## The Power of Consistent Practice\n\nLike any skill, photography improves with practice. But scrolling through Instagram or reading about gear won't make you a better photographer. You need to get out there and shoot.\n\n### Why Most Photographers Plateau\n\nMany photographers reach a certain level and stop improving. Why? Because they:\n\n- Only shoot when \"inspired\"\n- Stick to comfortable subjects and techniques\n- Focus more on gear than practice\n- Don't analyze their own work critically\n\n## Deliberate Practice in Photography\n\nDeliberate practice means:\n\n### 1. **Shoot Regularly**\nSet a schedule and stick to it. Whether it's daily, weekly, or somewhere in between, consistency matters more than intensity.\n\n### 2. **Challenge Yourself**\n- Try new techniques\n- Shoot in difficult conditions\n- Work with unfamiliar subjects\n- Experiment with different styles\n\n### 3. **Learn from Each Shot**\nDon't just take photos and forget about them. Review your work:\n- What worked?\n- What didn't?\n- What would you do differently?\n\n### 4. **Study the Masters**\nLook at work from photographers you admire:\n- Analyze their composition\n- Understand their use of light\n- Try to recreate techniques you admire\n\n## Beyond Technical Skills\n\nTaking more photos isn't just about improving technical skills. It's about:\n\n### Developing Your Eye\nThe more you shoot, the better you become at seeing potential images in everyday moments.\n\n### Finding Your Voice\nYour unique perspective emerges through practice. The more you shoot, the more you understand what draws your eye and what stories you want to tell.\n\n### Building Confidence\nEvery photo you take, successful or not, builds your confidence and understanding of your craft.\n\n## Practical Tips for Shooting More\n\n### 1. **The One-Photo-a-Day Challenge**\nCommit to taking at least one thoughtful photo every day. It doesn't have to be a masterpiece – just intentional.\n\n### 2. **Carry a Camera Always**\nWhether it's your phone or a dedicated camera, having one with you means you'll never miss an opportunity.\n\n### 3. **Set Projects**\nGive yourself assignments:\n- Document your neighborhood\n- Capture a color theme\n- Tell a story in 10 images\n- Focus on one technique for a week\n\n### 4. **Join a Community**\nFind other photographers to shoot with. The accountability and feedback accelerate improvement.\n\n## Quality vs. Quantity\n\n\"Take more photos\" doesn't mean \"spray and pray.\" It means:\n- Being intentional with your practice\n- Pushing yourself out of your comfort zone\n- Learning from both successes and failures\n- Building photography into your routine\n\n## The 10,000 Hour Rule\n\nMalcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that mastery takes 10,000 hours of practice. While the exact number is debatable, the principle holds: excellence requires sustained effort over time.\n\nEvery photo you take is an investment in your skills. Every moment you spend composing, considering light, and making creative decisions builds your expertise.\n\n## Start Today\n\nDon't wait for the perfect moment, the perfect light, or the perfect subject. The best time to improve your photography is now. Pick up your camera and start shooting.\n\nRemember: Every great photographer started exactly where you are. The only difference?

These aren't just resolutions that will be forgotten by February – these are commitments I'm making to myself for personal growth and creativity.\n\n## 1. Write at a minimum twice a week\n\nI've always loved writing, but I haven't been consistent with it. This year, I'm committing to writing at least twice a week. This could be blog posts, personal reflections, or creative writing. I'm even considering planning a novel and potentially participating in NaNoWriMo in November 2017. \n\nThe goal isn't just to write more, but to develop my voice and explore ideas that matter to me.\n\n## 2. Read at least a book a month\n\nTwelve books in a year might not sound like much to some, but for me, it's about being intentional with my reading. I want to:\n\n- Improve my reading speed\n- Broaden my perspective through diverse authors and topics\n- Make reading a priority in my daily routine\n\nEach book is an opportunity to learn something new or see the world through different eyes.\n\n## 3. Take pictures once a week\n\nPhotography has become more than just a hobby for me – it's a way to capture moments and tell stories. My motivation is deeply personal:\n\n- **For remembrance**: Life moves fast, and I want to capture the moments with Baby Jack and Lillian before they slip away\n- **For them**: Creating a visual record that my children can look back on someday\n\nWhether it's a formal photo session or just candid moments at home, I want to be more intentional about documenting our family's journey.\n\n## 4. Not do things out of guilt\n\nThis might be the most challenging goal, but also the most important. I want to:\n\n- Avoid actions driven purely by obligation\n- Find a healthy balance between serving others and taking care of myself\n- Make decisions based on genuine desire to help rather than guilt\n\nThis isn't about being selfish – it's about being authentic and ensuring that when I do help others, it comes from a place of genuine care rather than obligation.\n\n## Your Turn\n\nAs we embark on this new year together, I'm curious: **What are your goals for 2017?** \n\nWhether they're big or small, personal or professional, I'd love to hear what you're working toward this year.","src/content/blog/welcome-2017.md","87878618a58e3a54",{"html":177,"metadata":178},"\u003Ch1 id=\"welcome-2017\">Welcome 2017!\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>As we step into a new year, I want to share my goals for 2017.
