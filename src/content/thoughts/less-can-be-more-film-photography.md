# Less Can Be More: My Leap Into Film Photography

Photography is a hobby that offers continuous learning opportunities. No matter how experienced you are, there's always something new to discover, a technique to master, or a perspective to explore.

## The Digital Journey

Over the past few months, I've been exploring different camera systems. I rented and reviewed both the [FujiFilm X-Pro2](/blog/fujifilm-x-pro2-review) and the [Sony A7r II](/blog/sony-a7r-ii-review), experiencing firsthand the incredible capabilities of modern digital cameras. These cameras offer:

- Instant feedback
- Unlimited shots
- Advanced autofocus systems
- High ISO performance
- In-camera processing

But something was missing.

## The Film Inspiration

After reading several articles about film photography, particularly black and white film, I felt drawn to explore this "outdated" medium. There's something romantic about the process – the anticipation, the deliberation, the craft.

I started my film journey by borrowing a Minolta SRT-201 from my father-in-law. But as often happens with photography gear, I quickly found myself wanting more. That's when I discovered the Leica M3.

## The Leica M3: A Timeless Classic

> "The LEICA M3 is the best camera that LEICA has ever made, and by many accounts, the best camera of all time."

The Leica M3, introduced in 1954, represents the pinnacle of mechanical camera design. No autofocus, no light meter, no automatic modes – just you, the camera, and your understanding of light.

## Why Film Makes You Better

Film photography forces you to slow down and be intentional in ways that digital doesn't:

### 1. **Limited Shots**
With only 36 exposures per roll, every frame counts. You can't spray and pray – each shot requires thought and intention.

### 2. **No Instant Feedback**
You can't chimp (constantly check the LCD). You have to trust your skills and understanding of exposure.

### 3. **Manual Everything**
Film cameras, especially older ones, require you to understand the fundamentals:
- The relationship between aperture, shutter speed, and ISO
- How to read light without a meter
- Zone focusing techniques
- Composition without cropping

### 4. **The Cost Factor**
Film and processing aren't free. This economic reality makes you more selective about when you press the shutter.

## The Results

Working with film has transformed my approach to photography. Even when I pick up my digital camera, I find myself:

- Taking fewer, more thoughtful shots
- Paying more attention to composition in-camera
- Better understanding light and exposure
- Appreciating the moment rather than the screen

## Not Abandoning Digital

This isn't about abandoning digital photography – each medium has its place. Digital excels for:
- Professional work requiring immediate results
- Situations where you need high ISO performance
- When learning and experimentation are priorities

But film offers something different: a connection to the craft, a slower pace, and images with a distinctive character that's hard to replicate digitally.

## Getting Started with Film

If you're interested in trying film photography:

1. **Start Simple**: Borrow or buy an inexpensive film camera
2. **Learn the Basics**: Understand manual exposure
3. **Shoot Black and White**: It's forgiving and teaches you about light and shadow
4. **Find a Good Lab**: Or learn to develop yourself
5. **Be Patient**: Embrace the slower pace

## Conclusion

Film photography isn't just about nostalgia or being contrarian. It's about understanding the fundamentals of photography in a way that makes you better, regardless of what camera you're holding. 

Sometimes, less really can be more.
