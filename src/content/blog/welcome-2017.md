# Welcome 2017!

As we step into a new year, I want to share my goals for 2017. These aren't just resolutions that will be forgotten by February – these are commitments I'm making to myself for personal growth and creativity.

## 1. Write at a minimum twice a week

I've always loved writing, but I haven't been consistent with it. This year, I'm committing to writing at least twice a week. This could be blog posts, personal reflections, or creative writing. I'm even considering planning a novel and potentially participating in NaNoWriMo in November 2017. 

The goal isn't just to write more, but to develop my voice and explore ideas that matter to me.

## 2. Read at least a book a month

Twelve books in a year might not sound like much to some, but for me, it's about being intentional with my reading. I want to:

- Improve my reading speed
- Broaden my perspective through diverse authors and topics
- Make reading a priority in my daily routine

Each book is an opportunity to learn something new or see the world through different eyes.

## 3. Take pictures once a week

Photography has become more than just a hobby for me – it's a way to capture moments and tell stories. My motivation is deeply personal:

- **For remembrance**: Life moves fast, and I want to capture the moments with Baby Jack and Lillian before they slip away
- **For them**: Creating a visual record that my children can look back on someday

Whether it's a formal photo session or just candid moments at home, I want to be more intentional about documenting our family's journey.

## 4. Not do things out of guilt

This might be the most challenging goal, but also the most important. I want to:

- Avoid actions driven purely by obligation
- Find a healthy balance between serving others and taking care of myself
- Make decisions based on genuine desire to help rather than guilt

This isn't about being selfish – it's about being authentic and ensuring that when I do help others, it comes from a place of genuine care rather than obligation.

## Your Turn

As we embark on this new year together, I'm curious: **What are your goals for 2017?** 

Whether they're big or small, personal or professional, I'd love to hear what you're working toward this year.
