# Claude Code Setup Instructions

## Conversation Logging

This project uses a conversation logging system to preserve important context and decisions made during Claude sessions.

### On Startup:
1. Check that the `claude-conversations/` directory exists
2. Verify `.gitignore` includes `claude-conversations/`
3. Ensure `claude-conversations/save-context.sh` is executable

### During Sessions:
- Run `./claude-conversations/save-context.sh` to capture current project state
- This is especially important before:
  - Long breaks
  - Context switches
  - Major feature completions
  - When Claude's conversation might compact

### Session Summaries:
Ask Claude to create session summaries after completing major features:
```
"Claude, please create a summary of our conversation including all important decisions and code changes, and save it to claude-conversations/session_summary_[date].md"
```

### What Gets Logged:
- Git status and current branch
- Recent commits
- Files modified in current session
- Session summaries (when requested)

All logs are kept private and never committed to the repository.

## Website Specification Document: jdrhyne.me

Version: 2.0 (Revised)
Date: June 11, 2025
Author: Jonathan D. Rhyne (as specified to AI)

### 1.0 Project Overview

The primary objective is to develop and deploy a clean, fast, and content-focused personal website for Jonathan D. Rhyne. The website will serve as a personal blog to share articles about projects, technology, and other topics of interest. It will establish a professional online presence at the domain https://jdrhyne.me.

The project will be built using the Astro.js framework, leveraging the existing volks-typo theme created by the user as a foundational template. The task is to personalize this theme with specific content, branding, and information, and deploy it to the live domain.

### 2.0 Core Technology & Foundation

- **Framework**: Astro.js. The site must be a static site generated by Astro for optimal performance, security, and SEO.
- **Base Theme**: volks-typo. The project will begin by cloning the user's GitHub repository: https://github.com/jdrhyne/volks-typo. The core architectural and design principles of this theme must be maintained.
- **Content**: All blog posts and primary pages will be written in Markdown (.md).
- **Hosting**: The final build will be deployed to a modern static hosting provider (Vercel is the preferred default).
- **Domain**: The website must be configured to resolve at the custom domain https://jdrhyne.me.

### 3.0 Design, Branding, and Personalization

The aesthetic is defined by the volks-typo theme—minimalist, typography-centric, and focused on readability. The following modifications are required:

- **Site Title**: Change all instances of the default theme name to "@jdrhyne".
- **Site Tagline / Description**: Implement the following tagline in the site's central configuration file (e.g., src/consts.ts): "Code, Curiosity, and Continuous Growth—Scaling Ideas Beyond Paper."
- **Author Information**: All metadata related to the author (name, email, etc.) should be updated to "Jonathan D. Rhyne".
- **Favicon**: Generate a placeholder SVG favicon file named favicon.svg in the /public directory. This SVG should render the monogram "JR". The design should use a color palette of red, black, and white. This file will serve as a placeholder for the user to replace.
- **Social Links**: The theme's configuration for social media links must be updated with the following profiles:
  - GitHub: https://github.com/jdrhyne
  - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-rhyne-54084811/
  - X (Twitter): https://x.com/jdrhyne

### 4.0 Site Structure & Pages

The website will have the following pages, derived from the volks-typo theme's structure:

- **Home (/)**: 
  - Content: An introductory section containing placeholder bio text (e.g., "Lorem ipsum...").
  - Functionality: A list of the 5-10 most recent blog posts, displayed as titles with a publication date and a short summary.

- **Blog Index (/blog)**: 
  - Content: A complete, reverse-chronological listing of all blog posts.
  - Functionality: Each entry must link to the full blog post. Implement pagination if the number of posts exceeds 10.

- **Blog Post Template (/blog/[slug])**: 
  - Content: Displays the article title, publication date, and full Markdown content.
  - Functionality: Must correctly render all standard Markdown syntax. Utilize the existing code block styling from the volks-typo theme for syntax highlighting. Include "previous/next post" navigation links at the bottom.

- **About (/about)**: 
  - Content: Create a new Markdown page at this route containing only a title and placeholder text.

- **RSS Feed (/rss.xml)**: 
  - Functionality: Implement an auto-generated RSS feed for all blog posts using Astro's @astrojs/rss integration.

### 5.0 Content Strategy

- **Source Format**: All blog posts will be individual Markdown files (.md).
- **Location**: All posts must be located in the src/content/blog/ directory, following Astro's content collections pattern.
- **Post Frontmatter**: Each Markdown file must contain title, description, pubDate, and tags fields. The heroImage field is optional.
- **Initial Content**: To populate the site for its first deployment:
  - Create the stub Markdown file for the /about page as specified in section 4.0.
  - Create 2-3 sample blog posts as .md files in the content directory. These articles must be complete and feature a wide variety of Markdown syntax to demonstrate the theme's styling capabilities. This includes multiple heading levels (H1-H4), bold/italic text, blockquotes, ordered/unordered lists, hyperlinks, and multiple code blocks with various languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Bash).

### 6.0 Functional & SEO Requirements

- **Responsiveness**: The website must be fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **SEO**:
  - **Page Metadata**: Every page must have a unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tag. For the Home and Blog Index pages, the meta description can be auto-generated from the site tagline as a placeholder.
  - **Open Graph & Twitter Cards**: The blog post template must automatically generate social sharing card metadata. If a post's frontmatter does not include a heroImage, the site must use a default social sharing image. Create a placeholder image file (e.g., default-og-image.png at 1200x630px) in the project's assets for this purpose.
  - **Sitemap**: An auto-generated sitemap.xml must be present at the site root, using the @astrojs/sitemap integration.
- **Accessibility**: The site must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring semantic HTML, proper color contrast, and keyboard navigability.

### 7.0 Deployment Plan

The AI will follow these steps to deploy the website:

1. **Version Control**: Initialize a new Git repository for the personalized project code.
2. **Hosting Provider Setup**: Connect the Git repository to Vercel.
3. **Build Configuration**: Configure the Vercel project's build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/`
   - Node.js Version: 18.x or later.
4. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Add the custom domain jdrhyne.me to the Vercel project settings.
   - Output the required DNS records (A or CNAME) that the user must configure with their domain registrar.
5. **Initial Deployment**: Trigger a deployment to publish the site.
6. **Verification**: After deployment, verify that the site is live at https://jdrhyne.me and that all functionality is working as specified.
